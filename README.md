## Welcome to offshore
A Trojan Horse Virus is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide `malicious` code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software.

offshore can detect if they are being run in a sandbox or virtual machine and alter their behavior accordingly. They can check for signs of an analysis environment, such as the presence of debugging tools, and either lay dormant or terminate to avoid detection. Since offshore is build using an advanced **C++** and **C** can use rootkit techniques to gain deep access to the system and hide their activities.
